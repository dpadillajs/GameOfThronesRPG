### Assignment
I was tasked with having to make an RPG game using refined skills in JavaScript
and jQuery. I decided to use my favorite TV show of all time **Game of Thrones** 
to base my game around it's lore. It fit perfectly as a card game, so I decided
to use my CSS skills with CSS Grid, Flex, and Positioning to make it come to life.
Logic-wise, I had to assign these cards to different roles giving them
unique attributes to their health, attack power, and counter attack power. I also had
to make sure that the game would continue past the first battle until every enemy
had been defeated. Only then would the game end and the winner be crowned King/Queen
of King's Landing.

### Skills Learned
I learned many things while doing this project with the support of my wife 
who is also a very talented programmer and utilizing Google-Fu. Here are some things
I learned on the fly:

* object-oriented programming
* switch statements
* const variables
* this
* setTimeout()
* .parentNode
* .classList
* .contains()

**Also, feel free to refer to the comments within game.js to see how I integrated:**
* jQuery
* DOM traversal 
* functions
* variables
* if statements
* click events
* .append()
* .remove()

### Comments
Overall, I had so much fun with this assignment. My CSS skills have really come
a long way. I am a perfectionist by nature, so I never stop tweaking stuff lol.
So many sleepless nights. I think at one point I stayed up for 45 hours straight, 
but it was so worth it. Coding is awesome!!!
